              Brian Philip Welch (born June 19, 1970),also known by his stage
              name Head, is an American musician, singer and songwriter. He is
              one of the guitarists and founding member of the nu metal band
              Korn and his solo project Love and Death. Along with fellow Korn
              guitarist James "Munky" Shaffer, Welch helped develop Korn's
              distinctive sound, a mix of sirenlike shards of dissonant guitar
              that mimicked a turntablist's various effects and rumbling
              down-tuned riffing, that defined the nu metal aesthetic beginning
              in the mid-'90s.
